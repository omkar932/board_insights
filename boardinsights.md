Executive Summary
BoardInsight is an AI-powered analytics platform that transforms raw academic information into actionable intelligence, bridging the crucial gap between data collection and educational impact. Although our institution generates extensive academic data, much of it remains unused for enhancing teaching effectiveness, supporting students, or guiding meaningful academic decisions. BoardInsight unlocks this untapped potential by delivering distinct, powerful insights that help faculty identify struggling students early, highlight challenging course topics, evaluate assessment effectiveness, and track learning progression throughout the semester, tasks that currently demand significant manual effort.
Validated by leading faculty members, BoardInsight can be integrated into existing workflows and provides the comprehensive analytics necessary for informed decision-making. Its implementation promises to elevate teaching quality, strengthen student support, and position our university at the forefront of data-driven educational innovation.

The Critical Need
Our university faces significant challenges in leveraging educational data effectively. Faculty members spend considerable time manually analyzing student performance data across multiple assessments, struggling to identify patterns that could inform teaching improvements. The current approach makes it difficult to proactively identify struggling students early enough for effective intervention. There is also a growing need for evidence-based teaching methods and comprehensive learning analytics to support accreditation and continuous improvement.

What Professors Are Looking For
Based on extensive discussions with faculty, professors are seeking solutions that:
Save time on manual data analysis and administrative tasks
Provide early identification of struggling students for timely intervention
Offer concrete evidence of teaching effectiveness and student learning

Proposer's Background & Project Genesis
This proposal stems from my unique intersection of professional data analytics experience and direct academic involvement. I bring three years of professional experience working for IT companies, serving clients such as Huntington National Bank and Credit Suisse as a Data Analyst. In these roles, I specialized in transforming complex datasets into actionable business intelligence, which cultivated my deep interest in the power of data-driven decision-making.
Concurrently, during my tenure as a Teaching Assistant for Dr. Reza, I developed interactive dashboards to visualize student performance. This experience directly revealed the critical gap between the vast amounts of academic data we collect and its underutilization for enhancing teaching and learning. BoardInsight is designed to bridge that exact gap, applying professional-grade data intelligence principles to the core mission of educational excellence.
Conclusion
BoardInsight represents a significant advancement in educational technology that addresses critical needs while creating substantial opportunities for enhancement across our university. The platform has already demonstrated its value through faculty validation and successful demonstrations.
The implementation of BoardInsight will transform how we support both teaching excellence and student success, positioning our institution as a leader in educational innovation. I am confident that this initiative will make a substantial positive impact on our educational mission.
